Searched online about struct initialization

3:00pm, 12th November, Di and Adam helped me during office hours

Checkpoint 2

1:40am, 18th Nov, Used https://open.gl/textures and https://www.opengl-tutorial.org/beginners-tutorials/tutorial-5-a-textured-cube/

19th Nov, 2:38pm, OHQ: Adam and Emma helped Helena and I with a significant bug in our code, added if statements to check if elemcount for both of my VBOs were not zero before attempting to draw in terrain.cpp!!


(Some notes for myself):
Step by step addition of uniform sampler VBO for cpu-> gpu

1. GLuint handle for 2Duniformsampler in MyGL

2. In our shader program, get the handles to the variables stored in our shader (associated with some string)

unifSampler2D  = context->glGetUniformLocation(prog, "u_Texture");

3. Draw 

inside draw function, 

if(unifSampler2D != -1)
    {
        context->glUniform1i(unifSampler2D, 0);
    }

4. Add string handle to glsl frag shader!

!!! Super important for texture sampling:

You need to call glBindTexture(textureHandle, /*GL_TEXTURE*/textSlot) every frame in 
GLPaint!!!!!
